# Django Blog (Deployed in Cloud)

This is a Web App in Django Framework, using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap4 and few other dependencies.

I have created this website to replicate a blog website structure, you can:
* Create your registration with username, password, profile pic, and email.
* You can post a blog with title and content.
* You also have the ability to edit and delete the post.
* You can also get forgot password mail to your email if you click forgot password in the login page.

Please check the link below and let me know if there are any issues with the website.
